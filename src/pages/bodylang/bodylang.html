<h2 class="h">Hand gestures can aid communication</h2>
<p class="p"> Do you naturally talk with your hands? Go ahead and let them move during the interview.
Hand gestures play an important role in communication, helping you emphasise or reinforce key points and words.
 <br><br>Using right hand movements while you talk signifies that you are giving out information, while left hand gestures indicate your readiness to receive information. Open palms show openness and honesty.
<br><br>
Again, try to keep your actions smooth, measured and natural.
<br><br> Don't overdo or force hand gestures or you risk distracting your interviewer or worse, smacking them in the face by accident.</p>

<h2 class="h"> Suppress Restless Habits</h2>
<p class="p"> Speaking of fidgeting…if you're a nail-biter, knuckle cracker, hair twirler, or leg tapper, don't allow these habits to make an appearance during the interview.
   <br>All will appear unprofessional and convey nerves.
   <br><br><b> Plus:</b> Most of these actions are generally considered impolite.
  <br><br>From the moment you arrive in the reception area, you need to keep your posture perfect. 
  <br><br>Always be aware of your body position and avoid angling yourself towards the door, it’ll look like you’re planning a quick escape! Sit up straight and lean forwards a little when you’re asked question, it gives a sense of curiosity and engagement.</p>


  
 
  <h2 class="h"> Make eye contact with the speaker</h2>
  <p class="p"> It's important to make eye contact during your interview, but don’t mistake that for a directive to make constant eye contact. That is disconcerting and aggressive. 
 <br><br> At the same time, avoiding eye contact entirely comes across as untrustworthy and distant — it could make it seem like your answers are dishonest.
  <br><br>
  <b>Balance it out:</b> Aim to make eye contact as you listen and respond to questions, but allow it to break occasionally, and let your eyes wander.
   <br><br><b>Think:</b> How would I make eye contact if I were chatting with a friend?</p>

<h2 class="h">   Avoid Crossing Your Legs</h2>
<p class="p"> Most experts recommend against crossed legs. 
With a long interview, you might need to re-cross them because your leg is falling asleep. 
This could come across as fidgeting.</p>


<h2 class="h">Read the interviewer's body language</h2>
<p class="p">Body language is, of course, a two-way process. In the same way that interviewer reads (consciously or unconsciously) how you move and act, you can read their body language too.
<br><br>
<b>Look for positive or negative movements :-</b>
<br> Nodding, leaning forward, and tilting the head to one side are all positive indicators: your interviewer is interested and attentive.
<br><br> Arms crossed, tapping on the table, fiddling with nails or staring into the middle-distance could mean that things aren't going so well.</p>





<h2 class="h">Looking down at the table</h2>
<p class="p">When you’re answering a question or listening to someone speak, try not to allow your gaze to drift down to the table.
 <br><br>Lowering your eye line causes your head to bow and obscures the view of your face, which can give the impression that you aren’t committed to the answer and aren’t listening to the question.</p>



 
<h2 class="h">Tilt your head</h2>
<p class="p">
A subtle head tilt in body language is an excellent way to show someone that you’re interested in what they have to say and that you like it.
 <br><br>It  is a gesture which psychologists believe also shows that you are exposing vulnerability to the speaker by revealing your neck.</p>




<h2 class="h">Excessive pointing or head nodding</h2>
 <p class="p">Body language that uses excessive pointing gestures can make a person appear arrogant and confrontational.
 <br><br>
<b>Too much of a good thing can backfire.</b>
<br> Head nodding shows that you understand and are listening to a speaker, but doing it too much undermines how well you’re listening and gives the appearance of incompetence. </p>




 <h2 class="h">Smile</h2>
 <p class="p">Smile and nod where appropriate, and laugh when the interviewer does. You want to show you have a personality and you’re paying attention to what’s being said.
 <br><br>
 It goes without saying that you should listen attentively and try not to interrupt. Focus on keeping your tone of voice even and polite. Too soft and you’ll seem timid, too loud and you’ll seem domineering.</p>
 


<h2 class="h">Be confident</h2>
<p class="p">Body language plays an equally important role as verbal communication during a job interview. Good body language not only helps you stay positive, but it will also give your confidence a boost. 
<br><br>So, the next time you go for an interview, shake hands with the interviewer with your palm facing upward and make eye contact as you enter the room.</p>

 
 
 <p class="p"><b>Most importantly, be respectful and keep a professional personal distance at all times.
   <br><br> The first image the interviewer has of you is most likely the one that will stick, but a graceful goodbye is just as important as a classy hello.
<br><br>
Your aim is to always keep the focus on the conversation, so keep your expression interested, your posture confident and your head high from the moment you arrive in the lobby until the second you’re a safe distance away.</b></p>
