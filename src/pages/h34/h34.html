<h2 class="h">    How you feel about working late or during the weekends?</h2>
<p class="p">    Of the many interview questions and their answers, this one might seem like the trickiest, especially if you desperately want the job. 
  <br>However, agreeing to it when you are not okay with working round the clock and during the weekends won’t do you any good.
  <br><br>
    If you are cool with the timings, then you don’t need to think twice and say it works for you. But even if it doesn’t, avoid a flat out NO. Instead, frame your answer smartly.
    <br><br>
    Instead of telling the interviewer you are not okay with it, say why you are not okay with it. Give your reasons and talk about how you would like to work here and that you can contribute in so many ways to the company.
    <br><br>
    The company needs to see your value beyond your availability for night shifts or weekend shifts.
