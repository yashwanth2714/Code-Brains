<h2 class="h"> What are your expectations from your first job?</h2>
<p class="p">  You can always quote a simple vision or strategy which you like about the company. As a fresher, your most important expectation should be “To Learn” & this is what most companies expect from you.
  <br><br> There could be additional personal expectation like contributing to society, placing yourself within corporate world, paying off your education loan etc;
    <br><br>
  Examples:
  <br><br>
  “I have had lot of studies during all these years, but mostly theoretical leanings. My first & foremost expectation from my first job would be to learn how all these are applied in a practical and industrial way. I also want to be a part of the corporate culture and learn how this is run.”
  <br><br>
  “I consider my first job as an extension of my studies only. More like a practical class. I want to learn a lot of new technologies, learn how the corporate world works, be part of a big energetic team and contribute to the projects, develop myself to prepare myself for tougher challenges in future.”</p>
