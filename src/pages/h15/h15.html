<h2 class="h">  Are you willing to relocate/travel for work?</h2>
<p class="p">  Moving to a new city can be an exciting idea, but when a recruiting manager asks you this question, he is looking for something different than what you are thinking. He wants to judge your level of enthusiasm and passion for the job role.
    <br><br>
  Why this question:<br><br>
  A recruiter who asks this question is more privy to the demands of the job position than the candidate. And they’re filtering candidates on different counts – one being flexibility and availability at different locations and the other being an inclination to go places for the job.
  <br><br>
  They are also checking on your enthusiasm and willingness for the job on offer and the company.
  <br><br>
  What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
  With this one question the recruiter asks you:
  <br><br>
  Would you be open to travel for the job?<br>
  Would you be open to transfers for the job?<br>
  Would you be able to come in, when required?<br>
  Are you really keen on this job?<br><br>
  How to Answer:<br><br>
  While answering this question, emphasize on your willingness to work with the company. Show your enthusiasm for the job role.
  <br><br>
  Don’t respond with a ‘No’ even if you are not willing to relocate.</p>
