<h2 class="h">    Who do you think are our main competitors?
</h2>
<p class="p">  
    A hiring manager wants to know how aware you are of the field you are gearing for. And, the other companies with which they compete. Your answer to this question shows your degree of awareness of the industry.
    <br><br>
    What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
    They wish to know whether you’ve done the comprehensive company research, which would make you an essential hire. So, it boils down to assessing the seriousness, dedication and maturity of the candidate.
    <br><br>
    How to Answer:<br><br>
    To answer this question, you need to do a research about the chief rivals of the company. Ensure that you don’t speak out the gathered facts to the interviewer. Rather you should present an analyzed version.
    <br><br>
    You must not provide wrong facts and figures and disregard a firm in any manner. By doing this, you can reduce your credibility.
    <br><br>
    Don’t forget that the sole aim of the interviewer is to understand how your services can help the company in beating its major competitors.</p>
