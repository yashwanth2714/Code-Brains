  A common icebreaker, this is the candidate’s chance to set the tone of the interview and to present themselves in the best possible light.
<br><br>
<b>Why this question:</b>
<br><br>
The interviewer won’t jump to level difficult. They are experienced enough to handle all type of interviewees so the first question is normally to make the person comfortable. This doesn’t mean that the answer isn’t considered.
<br><br>
<b>What are they ‘really’ asking:</b>
<br><br>
It’s easy amble through on this one. After all, you have known yourself for many years. However, if you go into this without any preparation, then all those years won’t count for much.
<br><br>
By asking this question, the interviewer usually intends to know things beyond your resume.
<br><br>
<b>How to answer:</b>
<br><br>
Prepare well for this question and answer smartly. It would be better if you give a quick but well-defined summary of your background.
<br><br>
<b>Here are a few cues:</b>
<br><br>

Talk about your professional self, precisely.<br>
Don’t go into your whole life story.<br>
Talk about your achievements and strengths,<br>
Indulge in specifics, but don’t narrate your resume.
