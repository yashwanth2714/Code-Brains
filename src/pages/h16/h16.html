<h2 class="h">  Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?</h2>
<p class="p"> 
  When a recruiter asks you this question, there may be a lot of answers arising in your mind – “I would like to move up the hierarchy”, <br>“I want to be the best version of myself”,<br> “At your role”, or<br> “I want to see myself as a consultant.”
  <br> However, you should refrain from saying any of these out loud in an interview.
  <br><br>
  Why this question:<br><br>
  An open-ended approach to knowing about your career goals, this is an attempt to learn about the maturity level of the candidate, their willingness and dedication to the prospective job.
  <br><br>
  What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
  Repeating the above point, here are what they’re really asking:
  <br><br>
  Your goals<br>
  Your willingness to continue with the brand<br>
  Whether you would be a good role fit<br><br>
  How to Answer:<br><br>
  So, how do you answer this question? You can be honest and still answer them what they expect to hear from you. Just think about where this position can actually take you and how that is in line with your broader career goals.
  <br><br>
  The best you can do is be honest and try to keep your answer relevant to your job and the industry. Don’t share your plan of writing a novel in five years when you are applying for the position of a Programmer.</p>
