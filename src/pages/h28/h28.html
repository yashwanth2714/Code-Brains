<h2 class="h">  How quickly do you adapt to new technology?</h2>
<p class="p">
  Possible Answer :
  <br><br>
“I can adapt quickly to new circumstances. Since I am clear about my job role and I am mentally prepared to take up challenges, I feel I have the capacity to learn fast and apply my new knowledge.
<br><br>
During my student life, I had to clear new papers and projects in every semester and thoroughly enjoyed doing it. Similarly, I will enjoy picking up new technologies in my professional life as well.”
