<h2 class="h">  Are you comfortable with late night and weekend shifts?</h2>
<p class="p"> 
  Another tricky question asked commonly – especially at startups, mid-size companies and with volume-oriented roles, like sales. So, be ready for this one if you’re going to one of these interviews.
  <br><br>
  Why this question:<br><br>
  The question doesn’t mean your company is planning on ruining your weekends. But depending on workload, companies do need flexible candidates who can handle the pressure at the workplace and work late when required.
  <br><br>
  What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
  The recruiter is asking you:<br><br>
  
  How flexible are you?<br>
  Can you take initiative to sacrifice personal time for a situation?<br>
  Can you handle workplace pressure?<br>
  Can we rely on you to step up, if required?<br><br>
  How to Answer:<br><br>
  Ideally, a carefully enthusiastic response towards being occasionally willing to do so, is a good way to go.
  <br><br>  
  If you aren’t comfortable with it for some reason, state the reason politely. Or you can just say that it would be fine once in a while but you normally prefer maintaining a work-life balance.</p>
