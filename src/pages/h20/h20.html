<h2 class="h">  How much salary do you expect?</h2>
<p class="p">  
  Although this question comes so straight forward, the answer is complex. At the interview stage, when you have still not been finalised for the role, you won’t wish to give the chance up with an ambitious number. Neither would you want to commit to a small number and put yourself in a corner.
  <br><br>  
  Why this question:<br><br>
  From the interviewer’s perspective, this question is an obvious filter – whether the candidate would realistically fit the company’s budget or not. It is also a judgment call – on maturity, self-awareness and industry awareness.
  <br><br>
  What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
  Here is a list of questions they are really asking:
  <br><br>
  Have you thought about your worth?<br>
  What kind of salary do you expect?<br>
  Do you fit our budget?<br>
  What is the scope of negotiation?<br>
  Should we select you?<br><br>
  How to Answer:<br><br>
  Just because they are asking doesn’t mean you will get what you quote. In fact, it’s a test as well. Do not say something that doesn’t go well with the position.
  <br><br> Do your research before you quote any number. And, in other words, be realistic and keep in mind what not to say in an interview.</p>
