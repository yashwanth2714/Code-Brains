<h2 class="h">    Do you have any questions for me?</h2>
<p class="p">    
  It is the most commonly asked question towards the end of an interview. As it is one of the last questions of your interview, it leaves you with a final opportunity to leave your mark on the interviewer. And, that is why there should be no chance of not preparing for it.
  <br><br>
  Why this question:<br><br>
  Often interviewers ask this question to understand how well you’re prepared for this interview. They’re checking your preparation, enthusiasm, and readiness to work with the organisation.
  <br><br>
  What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
  They are asking you:<br><br>
  How keen are you on the job?<br>
  How confident are you about your chances?<br>
  Are you willing to learn from your experiences?<br>
  How eager are you to do this work?<br>
  ‘How to Answer:<br><br>
  Prepare a list of questions that you want to be answered. Your question should be asked to the relevant interviewer.<br><br>
   For example, if your interview is with the HR, your question should focus on the overall interview process or the organization’s structure. In case you are giving an interview to the person who will be your Manager, your question should focus on the kind of work and the work responsibilities.
  <br><br>
  Keep in mind that you don’t ask questions related to off-work activities like party and vacations. Avoid asking personal questions to the interviewer. Try asking one question at a time and make the whole process feel conversational.</p>
