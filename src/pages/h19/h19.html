<h2 class="h">  What’s your biggest accomplishment?</h2>
<p class="p"> 
  Another tough interview question for a fresher to face, this close-ended question is as much a test of calibre as of self-awareness.
  <br><br>
  Why this question:<br><br>
  An interviewer intends to know about your biggest achievements at work in the past and also about your work ethics.
  <br><br>  
  What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
  They wish to analyse you in a larger sense,  beyond the scope of standard interview questions and the resume. 
  <br><br>Your answer helps them gauge your level of maturity, insight, how you act in different situations. It is also an insight into your soft skills – confidence, problem-solving, initiative, self-management and adherence to tasks.
  <br><br>  
  How to Answer:<br><br>
  The best you can do is tell about an accomplishment that is directly related to your job. Give an instance from the last job where you did extremely well. 
  <br><br>Keep in mind that you mention the accomplishment that added value to the company. Focus more on the core values and show them how you can be an asset to the company.
  <br><br>
  On the other hand, don’t lie if you don’t have anything concrete to tell. Be honest that you are still waiting for something that can be called as your biggest accomplishment.</p>
