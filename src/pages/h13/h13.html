<h2 class="h">  What are your long-term goals? What are your short-term goals?</h2>
<p class="p">  
  This is to check your commitment towards the job. A casual query like this can turn into a probe into your maturity and the levels of dedication you maintain towards your overall work graph.
  <br><br>
  Why this question:<br><br>
  From a recruiter’s perspective, the job interview is the best time to get focused information from a candidate, which will help them make a decision about them.
  <br><br> Asking about their goals, both short-term and long-term goals, helps these recruiters understand where they are coming from and what plans they have for their lives.
  <br><br>
  What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
  This also lets them decide whether the candidate would be a good hire and would stay in the company. What motivates them and where would they go, if they face an opportunity in line with those goals – both internally and externally.
  <br><br>
  How to Answer:<br><br>
  Haven’t thought about your future, five years down the line, let alone in the coming six months? Start thinking. This is how you can answer this fresher interview question.
  <br><br>
  Think of what you want to do in 6 months, 1 year, 5 years<br>
  Include the Company in your plans<br>
  Begin explaining short-term goals.<br><br>
  Include long-term goals, but don’t talk about salary or explicit details<br><br>
  So, don’t say you want to earn a lot of money and then run away to Prague. Yes, there are interviewees casual enough to answer that. On the other hand, don’t say your long-term goal would be getting “your chair” (the interviewers). That will pretty much take away the job from you.</p>
