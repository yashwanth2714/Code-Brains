<h2 class="h">    Do you lie?</h2>
<p class="p">    Very direct and very scary!
  <br><br>
    This is one of the trickiest yet the simplest of all the interview questions with answers that we have talked about so far. How?
    <br><br>
    Well, for one, you are only human and the interviewer knows that. If you say you donâ€™t lie, then that will be the biggest lie and make you come across as someone who cannot be entirely trusted. 
    <br><br>
    So, unless and until you are intending on pulling off something very cheeky, it will be best to stick to the truth.
    <br><br>
    Talk about an instance when you lied and make sure it is not about a major lie but an innocent, white lie.</p>
