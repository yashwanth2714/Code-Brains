<h2 class="h">     When can you start?</h2>
<p class="p">
    This may seem to be a simple question, but it isn’t! For most candidates, it can feel like the most exciting question of their interview. But please stay calm as this doesn’t necessarily indicate that you have been selected for a position.
    <br><br>
    Why this question:<br><br>
    Usually, employers ask this question when they hire for an immediate joining and the position is essential to company’s operations.
    <br><br>
    What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
    The recruiters are judging your position right now – how eager you are for this position and how soon would they be able to close it, if they hired you.
    <br><br>
    A quick as soon as possible means you need this job straight up – maybe you’re between jobs and gives them an upper hand in the negotiation process.
    <br><br>
    How to Answer:<br><br>
    While answering this question, avoid sounding too desperate (even if you want to start it right at the moment!).
    <br><br>The best way you can respond to this question is by conveying that you wish to start it as soon as possible.
    <br><br>
    Communicate your eagerness to join soon.<br>
    Factor in your current commitments – for a fresher these could be the time you graduate, any upcoming plans.<br>
    Give a clear date.<br>
    Ask about the company’s needs and requirements</p>
