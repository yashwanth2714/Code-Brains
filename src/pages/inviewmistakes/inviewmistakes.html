  <h2 class="h"> Do some research</h2>
   
  <p class="p">   When you walk into a job interview, knowledge of the company’s history, goals and current activity proves to the interviewer that you are not only prepared for the interview, but also that you want to be a part of the organization. </p>
   
   <h2 class="h">Don’t lie</h2>
   
   <p class="p"> If the conversation drifts to a topic you’re not knowledgeable about, admit you don’t know the answer and then explain how you would go about finding a solution. Displaying your problem-solving skills is better than babbling about something you don’t understand.</p>
   
   <h2 class="h">Keep it professional</h2>
   
   <p class="p">   Although interviewers often try to create a comfortable setting to ease the job seeker’s nerves, business decorum shouldn’t disappear. Avoid offering personal details that can be controversial or have no relevance to the position, such as political and religious beliefs or stories about a recent break-up. </p>
   
   <h2 class="h">Know what to expect</h2>
   <p class="p">  Expect to hear staple interview questions: “What’s your biggest weakness?” “Why do you want to work here?” “Tell me about yourself.” “Why did you leave your last job?” These open-ended questions are harder to answer than they sound, so think about your responses before the interview.</p>
 
    <h2 class="h">Poor Communication Skills</h2>
    <p class="p">It's important to communicate well with everyone you meet in your search for employment. It is, however, most important to positively connect with the person who might hire you. Shake hands, make eye contact, exude confidence, engage the person you are speaking with, and you will let the interviewer know that you are an excellent candidate for this position before you even answer an interview question.</p>

<h2 class="h">Having negative body language</h2>
<p class="p">If you never smile, have a limp handshake, and don't make eye contact with the people you meet at the employer's location, and especially with the interviewer, you'll come across as too shy or too strange or simply not interested.
    <br><br>
To Avoid:<br><br>
Show your interest and enthusiasm. If you are naturally very shy or an introvert, express your enthusiasm as Wendy Gelberg, author of The Successful Introvert, suggests.
<br><br>
Smile, say hello, look them in the eye, and shake hands as though you really are happy to meet that person, and soon you will be.</p>


<h2 class="h">Not talking enough or talking too much</h2>
<p class="p">When in a job interview, you need to maintain a fine balance between talking too much and not talking at all. Both are two extremes of the same thread can cost you the job. While it is great to show enthusiasm, chattering away during the job interview can actually backfire.<br><br> <b>Don’t talk too much or too long and go off the topic.</b>
    <br><br>
Same goes for not talking enough. While your answer should be to the point, making it too crisp or short won’t help. Make sure that your answer is well thought out and you are not leaving the interviewer wanting more from your answer.</p>

<h2 class="h">Failing to follow up</h2>
<p class="p">Often, job seekers leave at the end of the interview(s) with a sigh of relief that the interview is over, and they can get on with their lives. They leave, and wait to receive a job offer.
    <br><br>
<b>To Avoid:</b><br><br>
Remember this is a demonstration of the quality of your work as an employee.To stand out in the crowd of job candidates, which usually number four or five, immediately send your thank you notes to each person who interviewed you. <br><br>
Also send a thank you to the external recruiter, if one was involved, or the employee or networking contact who referred you for the opportunity, if you were referred.</p>
