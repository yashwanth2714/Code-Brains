<h2 class="h">  Are you open to take risks? or Do you like experimenting?</h2>
<p class="p">  Possible Answer #1:
  <br><br>
  “It is always good to venture into new waters and new technologies. I am a very adaptive person and my diligence helps me pick up new stuff quickly. 
  <br><br>Experimenting or taking risks can yield both good and bad results, but the exercise in itself is a great learning experience. Such experiences generate experts and I want to become an SME or a JAVA subject matter expert someday.”
  <br><br>
  Possible Answer #2:
  <br><br>
  “This is a good question and a complex one. My answer would be both a No and a Yes. Personally, I like to experiment with new things, but I keep all my past mistakes in mind before taking a shot at a brand-new project.
  <br><br> For example, carpentry is my hobby and I love to build small furniture pieces with my new toolkit, which was a gift from my brother. But I will never venture into a complete home renovation project with that little kit! What I mean to say is that baby steps are fine, but I will not jump off a cliff at once.”</p>
