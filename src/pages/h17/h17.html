<h2 class="h">  What’s your dream job?</h2>
<p class="p"> 
  
  This is a very tricky question. It might happen that your dream job has nothing to do with the job for which you are being interviewed. Still, avoid mentioning it. Rather try connecting it to the position for which you are being interviewed.
  <br><br>
  Why this question:<br><br>
  Interviewers ask this question to know how this position motivates you. Or, whether you will stick to the position or you just want to take this up as a short-term assignment.
  <br><br>
  What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
  When a recruiter asks you about your dream job, they’re really asking you these questions:
  <br><br>
  What is your motivation<br>
  What are your positive stress points<br>
  Do these idyllic aspirations match our work environment<br>
  Would you fit into the current role/organisation <br><br>
  How to Answer:<br><br>
  Ideally, you should not answer specific job titles. Don’t share your ambitions about a job whose responsibilities are far from achievable while staying in the position that you are applying for.
  <br><br> A good idea is to focus more on skills and not the designation.
  Focusing on the industry is the key to answering this question.</p>
