<h2 class="h">  What are your thoughts about working in a team?</h2>
<p class="p">
  It is an unsaid rule that companies look for employees who can gel in well with their teams. 
  <br><br>Team players are future leaders, and a candidate who can’t work well in a team is more of a liability to the company than an asset.
  <br><br>
  Why this question:<br><br>
  Beyond core skills, the move towards finding the right-fit candidates is also dependant on their employability skills. 
  <br><br>It is these, which ensure that a candidate remains productive for the organisation and helps it along on an upward trajectory. And team skills remain core to these employability skills.
  <br><br>
  What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
  The recruiters are asking you:<br><br>
  
  Do you gel well within a team?<br>
  How do you perform, when you have to collaborate and coordinate with both within the department and outside?<br>
  Would you be a negative influence on the team? Would you hinder or hamper operations?<br><br>
  How to Answer:<br><br>
  Provide instances from your college or internship life to tell your interviewer how you are a team player.</p>
