  <h2 class="h">  Who is the most inspiring person in your life ?</h2>
<p class="p"> The important part is not who, but why? When you answer this question with a name, you should follow it up with why he / she is most inspiring person.
    <br><br>
  Example:
  <br><br>
  “My greatest inspiration is Sachin Tendulkar. He had such a humble upbringing & his hard work took him to the greatest heights in the world of sports. He still keeps himself rooted and stays humble. I also believe in hard work and humility”.
  <br><br>
  “My greatest inspiration is my dad. He has always thought me to not worry about my weakness and take most advantage of my strengths. This has developed a lot of confidence in me during difficult times.”</p>
