  <h2 class="h">What are your weaknesses?</h2>
  <p class="p">
  This is a trick question. The expectation here is to answer a negative trait with a positive twist. Something which in general a weak point of a person, but is alright from an organization perspective.
<br><br>
  Example
  <br><br>
  “I tend to try to take up too many things, leaving little time for myself.”<br><br>
  “I am a perfectionist and sometimes, concentrate too much on one single task to get it to perfection, using up time from other tasks”.<br><br>
  “I tend to say Yes, when someone asks for help. I am working on learning to say No at times”.
