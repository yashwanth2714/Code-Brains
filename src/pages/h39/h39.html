<h2 class="h">  What is the difference between hard work and smart work?</h2>
<p class="p"> Possible Answer :
  <br><br>
“Hard work is delivering work on time with more effort and smart work is delivering work on time, with lesser effort.
<br><br> I feel that is the basic difference. Most of the times, in the corporate world, I feel a combination of both is needed to attain excellence.”</p>
