  <h2 class="h">What are your key strengths ?</h2>
<p class="p">
    The idea here is to understand how much you know about yourself and how confident you are about your strengths.
<br><br>
    Just stay positive. Even a simple answer like “I am a very positive person” is good enough.<br><br>
    You can also change this as per the requirement of the interview. Knowing a bit about the profile you are being interviewed helps as well.<br><br>
    Explaining your strength with an experience from the past is desirable here.<br><br>
