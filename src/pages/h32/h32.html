<h2 class="h">    What kind of work environment do you expect?</h2>
<p class="p">   
    When you’re asked this question, don’t relax. This query comes from the niggling set of tricky fresher interview questions and is an attempt at understanding the ideal work environment for the candidate.
    <br><br>
    Why this question:<br><br>
    The employer is often interested in knowing if the employee would be able to fit into the environment of the office. 
    <br><br>
    Those factors can be the organization structure, leadership style, work-life balance, size of the company, etc. For instance, the environment of a start-up will be quite different than an MNC.
    <br><br>
    What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
    What a recruiter is asking you with this question?<br>
    Would you be a role-fit in our organisation?<br>
    What are your pain points? Would you leave an organisation if you don’t find your ideal environment there?<br><br>
    How to Answer:<br><br>
    Your answer to this question helps them identify your most productive environment. The best you can do here is show your flexibility. It is better to go to the company’s website in order to have a better understanding of the same.</p>
