<h2 class="h">   What do you know about this company?</h2>
<p class="p">  With this question, interviewers choose to filter the desperate candidates from the prepared ones. This question is not just about company knowledge but your dedication to the position that’s available and the company it’s available with.
  <br><br>
  Why this question:<br><br>
  Interviewers ask this question to know if you care enough to do research about the role and the company before coming to attend the interview.
  <br><br> Their goal is to hire people who want a specific job in the company and someone who is passionate about working there. They also want to judge your level of curiosity to know things.
  <br><br>
  What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
  Here is what they’re really asking:<br><br>
  
  Are you really serious about this job?<br>
  Have you invested time and effort in researching about our company?<br>
  How well do you know us? Our sector? Our strengths and Weaknesses?<br>
  Should we invest in you and bring you in as an asset to us?<br><br>
  How to Answer:<br><br>
  If you didn’t do your homework well, you can’t actually answer this question without stumbling and guessing. Read and research about the company you are interviewing for. More similar questions can be raised, so be prepared with enough information to build your answers on.</p>
