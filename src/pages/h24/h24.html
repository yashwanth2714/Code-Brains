<h2 class="h">  What makes you angry?</h2>
<p class="p">  Possible Answer #1:
  <br><br>
  “I get angry when I get falsely accused of something that I did not do. Lack of order and discipline also irritates me."
  <br><br>
  Possible Answer #2:
  <br><br>
  “In a team, there are times when I and some of my peers work hard to achieve a goal, while there are some people who leave their modules incomplete or quit mid-way. At such a juncture, this load also gets assigned to us, the hardworking lot.
  <br><br> I don’t mind helping my peers out, but when an extra load of work gets assigned to me in the 11th hour, I get irritated. Sometimes, when I know that I cannot do justice to this new module, I politely refuse to take it up.”
