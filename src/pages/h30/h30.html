<h2 class="h">  Create an imaginary difficult work situation and tell us how you will overcome it?</h2>
<p class="p">  
    Making up an imaginary work situation on the spot can be difficult. It is considered one of the toughest interview questions which test a candidate’s natural characteristics that can’t be analyzed in a short interview.
    <br><br>
    Why this question:<br><br>
    Interviewers ask this question in order to know how you will deal with an unprepared situation that might arise during your work tenure.
    <br><br>
    What are they ‘really’ asking:<br><br>
    A basic, open-ended question this allows the interviewer to understand the candidate beyond scripted answers and the brief on their resume.
    <br><br> It also lets them understand the likely ways in which the candidate would respond to challenges and the kind of situations they may face in their role.
    <br><br>
    How to Answer:<br><br>
    When this question is thrown at you, stay calm and composed. Go back to the past and think of any difficult situation you might have faced. It can be anything related to your past academics or professional career.
    <br><br>    
    You can tell about the dilemma of choosing your stream in the college, or about the unconventional career path you had to choose for yourself. You can mention who helped you during that stage of your career. Or, if you had to choose an unconventional career for yourself, how you persuaded your family members.
    <br><br>
    If you can’t link this question to any incidence from the past, you can instead relate it to your job description of the current job. You should develop an idea of unusual scenarios that might arise while in the job and the possible outcomes of that.
    <br><br> Avoid giving a long and unnecessary description. Your ideal response should be short and supported by relevant facts.</p>
